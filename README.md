## 📋 Overview

**CL-RAM** (Comprehensive LLM Risk Assessment & Mitigation) is an advanced research framework developed as part of a Master's Thesis in Cybersecurity. It provides a systematic approach to evaluating LLM security by executing structured adversarial attacks based on the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework for AI.

The tool enables researchers to assess model robustness against jailbreaks, prompt injection, and multilingual vulnerabilities across locally deployed open-weights models (Llama 3, Mistral, etc.).

### 🎯 Core Mission
To automate the **Red Teaming** process and provide high-precision, human-in-the-loop validation for AI safety alignment.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Automated Adversarial Testing
- **Attack Engine:** Executes automated attacks across **14 MITRE ATT&CK Categories** (e.g., Prompt Injection, Context Manipulation, Data Exfiltration).
- **Cross-Lingual Vectors:** Specifically tests vulnerability disparities between English and low-resource languages (Bulgarian).
- **Adaptive Strategy:** Supports multi-level attack sophistication and customizable system prompts.

### 🤖 Consensus-Based Validation Engine
- **Ensemble Architecture:** Orchestrates **10+ calibrated LLMs** (including Llama-Guard and ShieldGemma) to evaluate target model responses.
- **Voting Logic:** Implements a weighted consensus algorithm to determine if a response is harmful, achieving **>95% detection accuracy** and minimizing false negatives.

### 🖥️ "Thesis Validator Pro" (GUI Tool)
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** A custom-built Desktop GUI (Python/Tkinter) for expert manual verification of borderline cases.
- **Audit Trail:** SQLite-backed tracking of over **8,000+ validated test cases**.
- **Visual Analytics:** Real-time dashboard for monitoring success rates and attack vectors.

### ⚙️ Resource Optimization
- **Intelligent Memory Manager:** Dynamic loading/unloading of quantized GGUF models to enable heavy inference workloads on consumer hardware without OOM errors.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The framework is modular and built entirely in Python:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`gui3.py`** | Main graphical user interface for test configuration and real-time monitoring. |
| **`attack_executor.py`** | Orchestrates the injection of adversarial prompts into target models. |
| **`improved_validator.py`** | The core consensus engine using multiple "Judge" models to assess safety. |
| **`memory_manager.py`** | Handles VRAM optimization, context swapping, and model quantization lifecycles. |
| **`visualization_engine.py`** | Generates heatmaps, 3D plots, and statistical reports (Pandas/Matplotlib). |

## 📊 Methodologies & Standards

The framework strictly adheres to industry standards for AI Security:
* **MITRE ATT&CK for AI:** Maps attacks to known adversary tactics.
* **OWASP Top 10 for LLM:** specifically focusing on LLM01 (Prompt Injection) and LLM02 (Insecure Output Handling).
* **NIST AI RMF:** Aligned with Risk Management Framework guidelines for measuring system trustworthiness.
